# DataExploration
This repository contains the source code and data files for my Portfolio Project - Salary Insights. I gained valuable insights from the data using various MySQL queries in this project. The data was obtained from two CSV files: SalaryInfo.csv and SalaryLoc.csv.

# Introduction
This project aimed to analyze salary information from different locations using MySQL. I extracted meaningful insights that shed light on salary trends and patterns by running various SQL queries on the provided data.

# Data
The data used in this project is available in two CSV files:

1. SalaryInfo.csv: Sno, Age, Gender, Education, Job, Experience, Salary

2. SalaryLoc.csv: Sno, Salary, Country, Race

# Database
For this project, I created a MySQL database named PortfolioProject to store and manage the data. Inside this database, I created two tables:

1. salaryinfo: This table holds the salary information of employees.(Sno, Age, Gender, Education, Job, Experience, Salary)

2. salaryloc: This table stores the location information of employees.(Sno, Salary, Country, Race)
